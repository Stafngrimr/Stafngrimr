Hello! I'm Stafngrimr/Stephen Carder.

I am a traditional artist and aspiring programmer. Currently going through CS50 as well as the Odin Project.

Am looking forward to learning as much as I can and helping out with any other projects going to see what's out there. I don't have
a specific goal with my journey at the moment, just want to be sampling a bit of everything and seeing what fits best.
